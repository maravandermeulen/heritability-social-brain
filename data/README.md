# Data


*This folder contains the three datafiles (derived from the raw dataset) that are necessary to reproduce the study's results.*

---

The file `vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Data_BehGen_Behavior.csv` contains data for the participants included in behavioral heritability analyses.
The file `vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Data_BehGen_Univariate_Brain.csv` contains data for the participants included in MRI heritability analyses.
Results can be generated using the R code 'vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Script_Univariate_BehavioralGenetics.R'
Results from these univariate heritability analyses were reported in section 3.1 in the paper.

Additionally, the file `vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Data_BehGen_Univariate_Brain.csv` was used to generate within-twin correlation plots, that were reported in Supplementary Figure S1. These plots can also be generated by clicking the button Launch Binder at the top of the main page.

The file `vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Data_BehGen_Bivariate_Brain_Behavior.csv` contains data for the participants included in brain-behavior heritability analyses. Results can be generated using the R code 'vanderMeulen_DCN_2020_Script_Bivariate_BehavioralGenetics.R'
Results from these bivarite heritability analyses were reported in section 3.2 in the paper.
