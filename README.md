## Study summary

Prosocial behavior and empathy are important aspects of developing social relations in childhood. Prior studies
showed protracted structural development of social brain regions associated with prosocial behavior. However, it
remains unknown how structure of the social brain is influenced by genetic or environmental factors, and
whether overlapping heritability factors explain covariance in structure of the social brain and behavior. The
current study examined this hypothesis in a twin sample (aged 7–9-year; N ¼ 512). Bilateral measures of surface
area and cortical thickness of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), posterior
superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and precuneus were analyzed. Results showed genetic contributions to surface
area and cortical thickness for all brain regions. We found additional shared environmental influences for TPJ,
suggesting that this region might be relatively more sensitive to social experiences. Genetic factors also influenced
parent-reported prosocial behavior (A ¼ 45%) and empathy (A ¼ 59%). We provided initial evidence that
the precuneus shares genetically determined variance with empathy, suggesting a possible small genetic overlap
(9%) in brain structure and empathy. These findings show that structure of the social brain and empathy are
driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with some factors overlapping for brain structure
and behavior.

## Data summary

For this paper we used a sample of 512 participants. Since some participants missed data on either behavioral or neuroimaging measures, only subsets of participants were included in the final analyses. For a more thorough description see the methods section of the publication.
A flowchart of participant inclusion is visualized below.
